# ðŸš€ Simple Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD ðŸš€

## Objective
Set up a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of building and deploying an application.

## Tools Used
- Jenkins
- Docker

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a simple Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment stages of an application.

## Steps to Implement the Pipeline

1. **Install Jenkins**  
   Set up Jenkins on my local machine .

   ![Jenkins Setup](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/resources/img/jenkins-dashboard.png)  
   *Jenkins Dashboard*

2. **Create a Jenkinsfile**  
   Add a 'Jenkinsfile' to my project repository with the pipeline script defining stages such as `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.

3. **Configure Jenkins**  
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline job linked to my project repository.  
   - Enable **Poll SCM** or set up webhooks to trigger the pipeline on each code commit.

4. **Pipeline Stages**  
   The Jenkins pipeline should include the following stages:  
   - **Build:** Build the Docker image for the app.  
   - **Test:** Run tests to validate the build (optional, based on your app).  
   - **Deploy:** Deploy the built Docker container to the desired environment.

5. **Test the Pipeline**  
   Push changes to your repository and verify the pipeline execution on the Jenkins dashboard.
